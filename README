Mail Trends

Mail Trends lets you analyze and visualize your email (as extracted from an IMAP server). You can see:

Distribution of messages by year, month, day, day of week and time of day
Distribution of messages by size and your top 40 largest messages
The top senders, recipients and mailing lists you're on.
Distributions of senders, recipients and mailing lists over time
The distribution of thread lengths and the lists and people that result in the longest threads

This package was modified by Joao Paulo Barraca in order to fix some errors and work with a larger amount of servers.
In particular, the mail-trends will scan for all mailboxes and present global stats.
For GMAIL, it may produce duplicate stats unless you filter results to only consider the "All Mail" folder.

For the original version, please see: http://code.google.com/p/mail-trends/
